## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters a product review in the text box.
2. The review is sent to the Flask backend.
3. VADER analyzes the review and returns:
   - **Compound score**
   - **Sentiment label** based on the score
4. The result is displayed on the page.

### 🎯 Sentiment Interpretation

| Compound Score      | Sentiment  |
|---------------------|------------|
| >= 0.05             | Positive   |
| > -0.05 and < 0.05  | Neutral    |
| <= -0.05            | Negative   |
